# 👋 Hi, I'm Paul 
## 📌 About me

I am a **Data Analyst**  with a strong foundation in Power BI, Excel, and Sql, focused on transforming raw datasets into actionable insights that help businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.

Before transitioning into data analytics, I gained valuable experience in digital marketing, branding, content creation, and graphic design. This background taught me how to understand audiences, identify trends, and communicate ideas effectively — skills I now apply to data storytelling and business intelligence.

So far, I’ve:

✔ Built dashboards from different industries(Finance, automobile, education, Supply chain) that uncovered key business drivers in the different industries

✔ Cleaned and structured complex datasets for analysis

✔ Delivered insights and recommendations that support growth strategies

I’m passionate about bridging the gap between data and decision-making, and I’m eager to continue developing my expertise while contributing to teams that value innovation and results.
